## What is this?
Entry for a "Build Your Own Advanture" coding challenge. Objective: help Felix achieve his goals.

## How To Run
clone the repository, then run the command below to play:
```
python main.py
```
## Cool Things
- Slow text, but you can skip the slow text instantly with input, so it's easy to skip for replayability.
- For the first 3 options, you can do them in any order, but depending on which of the 3 options you handle first, the options and outcomes and text of the other options can be different.

## Unfortunate Thing
- The ability to change Felix's apparel only does ONE thing with one of the customers. It would have been funny to carry it over into the other problems to solve, but there wasn't time to implement it this way.

## Optional Challenges (Hidden Options)
- Unlock/Choose the 4th life companion option
- Get "The Deadliest Person You Know" to fight the lizard king
- Sell Mrs. Robinson Life Insurnace, with the power of acting!
