Felix takes Stacy out on a first date to an Olive Garden; On the date, everything is going well. Stacy laughs at Felix's jokes. Then, Felix tells her he's been having a tough time with his job. After this, the mood changes a bit, in an awkward way. Because it turns out, Stacy a gold digger. So after hearing this, Stacy says she has to go to the bathoom and never comes back.
Why didn't you help Felix with his job before talking with Stacy?...

Felix takes Stacy out on a first date to an Olive Garden. Everything is going well. Stacy laughs at Felix's jokes. She loves hearing about Felix's financial stability and says she would like to be a stay at home mom one day. Felix thinks it's very forward of Stacy to imply that she wants kids on a first date, but he likes Stacy for this.
Congratualtions...Felix has Stacy as a girlfriend now!

Lizarda (Slim, 5'7, Dark-Skin, Blonde, TNAL: Totally Not A Lizard)
Even though Felix feels uneasy about going out with a woman named Lizarda. The dating app matched them together, so it must be for a good reason, right? Well, no. Felix invites Lizarda to his house and booby traps it incase Lizarda turns out to be a lizard-person. When Lizarda arrives to Felix's house, she notices the traps and decides to leave, but not before calling Felix a loser and a freak. Ouch.
Why would you choose to make Felix go out with a girl whose name contains "Lizard" when Felix is paranoid of shapeshifting reptilians roaming the Earth?

Lizarda Alt
Now that Felix is over his fear of lizard people, his date with Lizarda goes very well. Lizarda takes Felix out to a play as she expresses her love for theatre and her goal to be an amazing actress, which is ironic given that this skill would be VERY dangerous in the hands of a shapeshifter. But Felix is way past this fear now. He laughs at the play and smiles at Lizarda's passion. And Lizards enjoys Felix's company a lot as well.  
The two decide to go on more dates afterwards, and it grows into something truly beautiful. Congratualtions Felix!

Samantha (burly woman, 6'5, orange-hair, light-skinned, dresses like a biker)
Felix reaches out to Samantha, and she takes Felix out for axe-throwing, and she is frightently good at it. Felix asks who she's defending herself against? And she says in a joking way.."Lizard People, they might be disguised as strangers in business suits". Except she isn't actually joking. Anyway, Felix says "No way, you're scared of those guys too?". So Felix and Samantha bond over their common paranoia of shapeshifting reptilians, and they hit it off real well!
Lucky Felix. He found someone just like him...perhaps more than he realizes. Heeheehee.

Felix reaches out to Samantha, and she takes Felix out for axe-throwing. She's frightently good at it. Felix asks who she's defending herself against? And she says "Lizard People". Felix is a bit surprised, but responds amusingly by saying "oh yeah, those guys will get ya. Let me see if I can get better at axing em!". Samantha is amused, and Felix has fun with the axe throwing and spending time with Lizarda.
Their partnership lasts, and eventually Felix helps Lizarda overcome her paranoia as well, so no one has to get axed.

Nathan
Now that he thinks about it, Felix is actually indifferent about the gender of his companion, so he contacts Nathan to accept his date offer. So Felix and Nathan have lunch together, get to know each other, then Nathan decides to take Felix to a metal concert because Felix has never been to ANY sort of concert before. Even though Felix isn't the biggest fan of metal (yet), he really enjoys Nathan's company, enough to consider him as a life partner. And luckily for Felix, Nathan is hopelessly in love, despite Felix's flaws. Don't ask why. Love doesn't have to make sense.
Felix has gained an unexpected life companion. Way to go!

Nathan (Single, no kids)
Nathan doesn't really have other people who would benefit from life insurance if he died, but Nathan might be interested in investing for his retirement. So Felix goes over to Nathan's apartment in an attmept to sell Nathan Life Insurance. Felix knocks on Nathan's door, and Nathan answers. Nathan says.."Alright, I'll bite.

So Felix goes over to Nathan's apartment in an attmept to sell Nathan Life Insurance. Felix knocks on Nathan's door, and when Nathan answers, Felix says "Nathan, I've come for you...to ask you about life insurance!". Nathan laughs at the joke, but unfortunately, he can't take Felix seriously enough to consider buying life insurance. But, Nathan does take interest in Felix and his unconventional methods, so he decides to give Felix his phone number, just incase..wink ;)  
In any case, it looks like this sale didn't quite work out, unfortunately.
1. Back to people to sell to
Nathan lost as potential customer, but he is intrigued

Tell Nathan about Term Life Insurance
Nathan tells you his job already provides him with term life insurance. And he doesn't currently have anyone in his life who he'd like to list as beneficiaries (he's quite lonely). In any case, he decides your suggestion is a waste of time, so he wishes you a nice day before closing the door.
Well...it could have been worse. Maybe you could succeed with someone else.
1. Back to people to sell to
Nathan lost as potential customer

Tell Nathan about index annuities & cash value benefits
Nathan finds the indexed annuities a potentially useful way to support himself after retirement, and cash value policies that last a lifetime could also come in handy. Nathan says he'll need time to think about this, so you give him your contact info before saying bye. A couple days later, Nathan calls you so he can fill out an application for a policy. The policy is issued. 
Congratualtions! Felix made his first sale!

Tell Nathan about the Joint-Life Policy
A joint-life policy insures more than one person, and pays the coverage when one dies. It's common with spouses and business partners. Nathan tells you he is alone and single, and says that the idea you would suggest him such a policy hurts his feelings. Nathan says he has to go with watery eyes, and he closes the door on you.
Dang, a failed sale attempt, and Felix feels bad for hurting Nathan's feelings. Maybe you could succeed with someone else.

Mrs. Robinson is a stay-at-home mom, and she has time to listen to Felix for just ONE pitch, but luckily, a recently-homeowners family with 2 kids checks a lot of boxes for people who could use insurance policies.

Felix tells Alice that business owners with multiple owners have a high chance of failing should any one of the owners disappear, unless they are both insured, which they are not. You explain that joint-life policies are often used for spouses trying to support a family, or by business partners who could use the coverage to offset the loses and liabilities resulting from an owners death. Alice realizes both of these situations apply to her, and decides to talk it over with her husband, Cooper. This leads to them calling you back a few days later, and a sold policy.

Felix does much better at selling life insurance now. He's made 5 more sells over the next 3 weeks, which is pretty great. I guess all Felix needed was that first sale to gain the confidence he needed to do well and stay motivated. 
This goal is now complete, and Felix is financially stable.

Felix becomes good at his job

Help him overcome his reptilian paranoia
So you want to help Felix overcome is paranoia? Neat. Ok, so to help Felix, you show him a series of images that will create his next dream when he sleeps, then Felix falls asleep. In the dream, Felix is on a post-apolyptic Earth, where the sky is dusty and orange and the lizard people rule the world, treating humans as weaker, inferior beings. Felix is in a collisuem, waiting to head out into a battlefield where he will be battling many lizard people to the death. Lizard people are naturally stronger than humans, so Felix has little chances of winning, but Felix does have the power to dream up weapons that could maybe help him win, so that he can challenge and defeat the Lizard king after.
Which weapons will you arm Felix with in his battle against the lizard people?
1. A rubber chicken & water gun
2. A leaf blower that shoots blizards & a shortsword
3. A stick?

A rubber chicken & water gun
Felix grabs the rubber chicken and water gun and charges towards the first reptilian he sees. Felix pelts the lizardman's chest with the rubber chicken, repeatedly making a squeaking noise. The lizardman laughs, Felix becomes paralyzed with fear, and the Lizard man eats Felix.
Seriously, why did you think that would work? You sent the poor man to die.

A stick?
Felix takes the stick because he has some trust in it as a weapon, for some reason. As it turns out, he picked a great weapon. It's a wand! After entering the battlefield, Felix repeatedly flicks the wand while yelling "AVADA KADAVRA!" to defeat the charging reptilians. Felix wins the first battle, but now he has to face the lizard king.
Unfortunately, yelling out "Avada Kadavra" doesn't seem to work on the lizard king. You might have backed Felix into a corner with your prompt choice, but perhaps Felix can try a new spell.

A leaf blower that shoots blizards & a shortsword
Felix grabs the blizzard shooting leaf blower with both hands after he places the shortsword on a sheath behind his back. Felix heads out into the collisuem, where the lizard people mindlessly charge at him. Felix blows cold freezing snow and winds towards the lizard people, and this makes their cold-blooded bodies slow and lethargic, to the point where Felix can easily overpower them. As Felix chills each lizard person, he finishes them with his shortsword, cutting their heads off or fatally stabbing them. Felix wins the first battle. But now he has to face the lizard king, who is twice his size and has some tough looking scales. With the last usage of the leaf blower, Felix chills the lizard king to make him slow enough to land a precise blow, but he only has time for one strike.
How should Felix damage the lizard king with his shortsword?
1. Slash at the lizard king's thick scaly neck
2. Attempt to blind the lizard king by slashing out his eyes
3. Cut off the lizard king's big tail

Slash at the lizard king's thick scaly neck
Felix swings his sword as hard as he can to slice open the lizard king's throat, and while he swing does damage, it doesn't cut deep enough to seriously wound the Lizard King; the scales are too tough. The lizard king takes Felix's blade and breaks it in two. Then he crushes Felix with a bear hug before swallowing him whole, anaconda style.
What a terrifying end for Felix. Although it was only in a dream, Felix's paranoia and fear of lizard people are now worse & unconquerable.

The Deadliest Person You know
Felix grabs a sickle & chain and nervously steps out into the battlefield. The lizard gladiators notice Felix and start charging at him. Suddenly, Felix hears a motorcycle loudly approach from behind him, being ridden by a large person in rugged black clothes and a helmet. The rider zooms past Felix, charging into the horde of Lizard fighters. The mysterious rider lights a fuse on the motorcycle, then jumps off, allowing the bike to blow up almost all but two of the Lizard people ahead of Felix. One of the lizardman charges at the rider, but the rider pulls out a tomahawk and throws it into the lizardman's skull. The other lizardman, who can now only crawl, is slowly clawing his way towards Felix, perhaps begging him for mercy? Either way, the mysterious rider catches up and crushes the crawler's skull with their big biker boot.
The rider takes off their helmet, and Felix has never been more in love...It's Samantha! His hulking she-warrior of a girlfriend.

Let Felix fight the lizard king?
The Lizard King jumps into the battlefield, letting out the most intimidating roar. Wanting to look good in front of Samantha, Felix charges at the lizard king, but Felix struggles fighting the king. So Samantha effortly throws an axe that takes out one of the lizard king's eyes and stuns him. This gives Felix a chance to land a precise blow, but he only has time for one strike.
How should Felix damage the lizard king with his sickle and chain?

Let Samantha. She. is. SCARY
The Lizard King jumps into the battlefield, letting out the most intimidating roar. While Felix is distracted at how terrifying this is, he hears a louder sound right next to him. "Vroom!" Somehow, Samantha has found ANOTHER motorcycle. She takes the Sickle & Chain from Felix's hands, then she rides towards the Lizard King. When she gets close, she throws the chain and manuevers the bike so that the chain wraps tightly around the Lizard King's neck. Samantha then drags the Lizard Kings body around the battlefield as he tries to free himself. When finally Samantha stops the bike, the Lizard King is on his stomach and is VERY weakened. Samantha gets behind the Lizard King and chokes him out with her big meaty thighs, like Zangeif from Street Fighter.
The Lizard King tries to tap out, then, he reaches out to Felix for mercy. He manages to let out a measly "Helllp" before dying. After the deed is done, Samantha releases the Lizard King's neck; she stands up proud, turns towards Felix, then smiles a hearty smile while giving Felix the manliest thumbs up he's ever seen.

End with Samantha
Felix is a new man. He's achieved all his goals, and now he wants to dedicate his life to being a warrior just like Samantha. Samantha trains Felix each day, having him wake up early for exercise, weapons training, and motorcycle riding lessons. Felix hopes that one day, he too can be at a point where he can choke an enemy out with his thighs. His passion has never been hotter.
And Felix has you to thank for this. "Thanks for Playing"

End with Nathan
Felix is a new man. He's achieved all his goals, and with Nathan at his side, he's learned to really branch out into the world. Nathan helped Felix get an online job in sales so they can travel the world together, trying to fit in everything the world has to offer. Nathan pushes Felix into trying new things pretty often, and for Felix, it's anything but boring.
