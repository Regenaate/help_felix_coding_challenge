# (trigger) - "Help him find a girlfiend"
# (value) - You want to help him get a girlfriend? Alright. So Felix tells you he matched with 3 different women on a dating site. But he can't decide which one he wants to ask out. He doesn't know anything about the women besides their names, but he wants you decide which one he should try first.
# (question) - Which woman will you suggest for Felix to take on a date?
# (Options):
# 1. Stacy (Stacy is a cold gold digger, so you'll have to get good at your life insurance job first. Felix won't be the happiest with her, but it will achieve his goal of companionship)
# 2. Samantha (Samantha will only work if Felix hasn't overcome his paranoia, because she has paranoia too. She isâ€¦kind of a psycho and can help you achieve your life insurance goal by instilling fear into your potential clients. In the end, she'll admit that she's actually a man, but you'll outgrow it and live happily ever after.)
# 3. Lizarda (so Lizarda will only work if Felix overcomes his paranoia first. Otherwise, you'll lose. But if he does, she will help him out with selling life insurance with herâ€¦soft skills ðŸ˜‚)
