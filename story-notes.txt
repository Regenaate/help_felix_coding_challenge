Coding Challenge Prompt Ideas
 
So youâ€™re a therapist, and your client (Felix) wants your help on how to achieve his goals. Felix has 3 goals, and you must help him achieve each of them.

His goals are simple. He wants to get a girlfriend for support & companionship. He wants to get better at his job selling life insurance so he can earn more cash, and he wants to overcome his paranoia of believing that some people are secretly shapeshifting reptilians plotting for humanityâ€™s demise. 

So which of Felixâ€™s goals will you help him out with first? 

1. Help him get a girlfriend
2. Help him improve at his job
3. Help him overcome his reptilian paranoia
 
 
If you choose
Girlfriend?
- You want to help him get a girlfriend? Alright. So Felix tells you he matched with 3 different women on a dating site. But he canâ€™t decide which one he wants to ask out. He doesnâ€™t know anything about the women besides their names, but he wants you decide which one he should try first. Which woman will you suggest for Felix to take on a date? 

1. Stacy (Stacy is a cold gold digger, so youâ€™ll have to get good at your life insurance job first. Felix wonâ€™t be the happiest with her, but it will achieve his goal of companionship)
2. Samantha (Samantha will only work if Felix hasnâ€™t overcome his paranoia, because she has paranoia too. She isâ€¦kind of a psycho and can help you achieve your life insurance goal by instilling fear into your potential clients. In the end, sheâ€™ll admit that sheâ€™s actually a man, but youâ€™ll outgrow it and live happily ever after.)
3. Lizarda (so Lizarda will only work if Felix overcomes his paranoia first. Otherwise, youâ€™ll lose. But if he does, she will help him out with selling life insurance with herâ€¦soft skills ðŸ˜‚)

If you choose,
Help him improve at his Job?
- You want to help Felix improve at his job?Alright. So Felix tells you heâ€™s actually never made a sale before, but he certainly has enough training to make a sale. He just needs to find the right people to sell to. Luckily, you know a few people that Felix can try to sell to. Who would you advise Felix to try to sell to?
 
 
- Nathan (Heâ€™s Single, but loves investing and thinking about his financial future) Youâ€™ll win if you tell him about the annuity or cash value option and donâ€™t bring a paranoid Samantha. Or if you tell Lizarda about the sale attempt beforehand. You can also win if you wear the reaper costume. 

- The Robinsons (Family with 2 kids, homeowners on a mortgage) Youâ€™ll win as long as you get over your paranoia first and donâ€™t bring a paranoid Samantha. Or if you tell Lizarda about the sale beforehand

- Alice & Cooper (Husband and Wife starting a business) Youâ€™ll win if you tell them about the joint life policy and donâ€™t bring a paranoid Samantha. Or if you helped Samantha, she will help you win here if you tell her about the sale. Or if you tell Lizarda about the sale beforehand

What do you wear when selling to the client?
- Black Hooded Cloak (only works for Nathan)
- Polo and slacks (works for everyone) 

- If you have Lizarda as a partner, youâ€™ll pass this one automatically if you tell her about your upcoming sale attempt. Sheâ€™ll stage a theatrical death scene in front of your client so theyâ€™ll realize how fragile life can be and take the insurance. Otherwiseâ€¦you have these options
- Samantha will ruin it for you if you told her about the upcoming sale attempt and havenâ€™t helped her overcome her reptilian paranoia. (This is a lose case, and you will be both be arrested)
- otherwise, you will have these default options.
- Talk about the term life insurance (only works for family)
- Talk about annuities and cash value opportunities (works for all)
- Talk about the joint life policy (works for family or couple)
- Summon girlfriend to help (if you have Samantha or Lizarda)

If you choose,
Help him overcome his reptilian paranoia?

So you want to help Nathan overcome his reptilian paranoia first? Good choice.
- As a therapist, you also specialize in dreamscapes, so you decide to show Felix a series of images that will create the next dream he has when he sleeps, then you hypnotize Felix so that he falls asleep. You can see his dream play out on a screen.
